# Texas-Hold-em-Hands
## ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠
#### Potential solution for jakber's Kata [3kyu level]
##### It is a function written in JS, checking type and rank of given Texas Hold'em Poker hand.

I came up with this Kata on codewars, when practicing JavaScript.
As a poker fan, I decided to try my best with this Kata, and here's what it is after 8 exhausting hours of work 😫

<b>IMPORTANT</b>:
Not 101% sure it works on EVERY SINGLE poker combination, but it worked for me 20 tests in a row (1300 combinations) on Codewars.

Maybe a future project idea.....? 🧐😏🤔
